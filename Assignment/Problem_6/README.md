Write a Python function that generates a matrix with n rows, each row containing a permutation of size 8 (n input
parameter) and a value representing the quality of the permutation. The quality of an
individual P (permutation of size 8) is given by the number of pairs (i, j), where i < j, for which P(i) = j and P(j) =
i. Evaluate the n generated
individuals and display the maximum value of quality.
