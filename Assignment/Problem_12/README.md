Write a Python function that generates a matrix with 10 rows, each row containing vectors with 8 elements: 7 bits
representing an individual and an integer representing its quality. The quality of an individual is given by the number
of 1 bits at odd positions â€“ the first position in the vector is considered odd. (for example, the quality
of [1,0,0,1,1,0,1] = 3). Calculate and display the average quality of the 10 individuals.
