Write a Python function that generates a matrix with 15 rows, each row containing a permutation of size k (an input
parameter) and a value representing the quality of the permutation. The quality of an individual P (permutation of size
k) is determined by the number of pairs (i,j), i<j, for which P(i)-P(j) equals an even number. Evaluate the 15 generated
individuals and display the maximum value.
