Write a Python function that generates a matrix with n rows (n input parameter), each row containing 9 values: a) an
individual vector of size 8, with elements being integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} and with the property that the value
at the 5th position is odd; b) the quality of the individual. The quality of an individual is given by the product of
its elements. Calculate and display the weakest individuals (with minimum quality).
