Write a Python function that generates a matrix (population) with 18 rows of vectors with 6 elements: 5 bits
representing an individual and an integer representing its quality. The quality of an individual is determined by the
number of consecutive differing value pairs (for example, the quality of [1,0,0,1,1] = 2). Calculate and display the
individuals with the highest quality function value.
