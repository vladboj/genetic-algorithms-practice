Write a Python function that generates a matrix with n rows (where n is an input parameter), each row containing 10
elements: a binary vector individual of size 9, with 5 bits equal to 1, and the associated quality of the sequence. The
quality of an individual is determined by the sum of positions containing 1. The first position is 0 (for example, the
individual [1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1] has a quality of 25). Calculate and display the generated individuals along with their
qualities.
