Write a Python function that generates a matrix with 10 rows, each row containing: a) a permutation P of size k (where k
is an input parameter), with the property that P(1)=1 and P(k)=k; b) a value representing the quality of the
permutation. The quality of an individual permutation P (of size k) is determined by the number of elements i such that
P(i)<i. Evaluate the 10 generated individuals and display the maximum value.
