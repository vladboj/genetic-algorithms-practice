Write a Python function that generates a matrix with 10 rows, each row containing 7 values: a) an individual vector of
size 6, with elements as integers from the set {−2, −1,0,1,2,3,4} and with the property that the sum of the elements is
less than 10; b) the quality of the individual. The quality of an individual is given by the product of the absolute
values of its elements. Display the generated individuals in reverse order of their qualities.
