Write a Python function that generates a matrix with n rows, each row containing a permutation of size 7 (where n is an
input parameter) and a value representing the quality of the permutation. The quality of an individual permutation P (of
size 7) is determined by the number of pairs (i,i+1) for which P(i)=i+1 and P(i+1)=i. Evaluate the n generated
individuals and display the maximum value of quality.
