Write a Python function that generates a matrix with 10 rows, each row containing k+1 values (where k is a given
parameter): a) an individual vector of size k, with elements as integers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6} and with the
property that the value at the last position is an even number; b) the quality of the individual. The quality of an
individual is given by the product of its elements. Display the generated individuals in ascending order of their
qualities.
