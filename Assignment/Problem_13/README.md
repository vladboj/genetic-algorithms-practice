Write a Python function to implement the maximum function:

𝑓 : {𝑥 = (𝑥1, … , 𝑥7) ⁄ 𝑥𝑖 ∈ [−10,10], 𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝑥7 ≤ 10} → ℝ

𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎1 ∙ 𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝑎7 ∙ 𝑥7

where 𝑎 = (𝑎1, … , 𝑎7) is a constant vector, given as input. Generate 10 elements from the solution space, evaluate
them, and display the maximum quality along with an individual with that quality.
