Write a Python function that generates a matrix with n rows (n input parameter), each row containing an individual
binary vector of size 8, with an odd number of 1 bits and the associated quality of the string. The quality of an
individual is given by the decimal value of its binary representation (the individual [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1] has quality 3).
Calculate and display the best individuals (with maximum quality).
