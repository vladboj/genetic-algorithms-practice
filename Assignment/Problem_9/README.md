Write a Python function that generates a matrix with 10 rows, each row containing vectors with k+1 elements (where k is
a given parameter): k bits representing an individual and an integer representing its quality. The quality of an
individual is determined by the number of pairs of consecutive equal values. (for example, for k=5, the quality
of [0,0,0,1,1] = 3). Display the generated individuals in ascending order of their qualities.
