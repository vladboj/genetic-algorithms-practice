Use a GA to place M objects in a NxN matrix such that:
- two distinct objects are placed into two distinct rows;
- two distinct objects are place into two distinct columns
- for each pair of objects having the positions (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the positive integer numbers |x1-x2| and |y1-y2| are either both even or odd.
