An investor wants to buy securities and the available budget is 80.000 lei. There are three types of securities: 
- T1, which pays 3% interest, and the risk factor is 1
- T2, which pays 4% interest, and the risk factor is 3
- T3, paying 3.5% with the risk factor 2. 

The investment should be such that: 
1.    its value is at least 50.000 lei;
2.    the mean risk factor is below 1.5.
Use a GA to find a vector (x,y,z) such that the amount invested in T1 is x, the amount invested in T2 is y, the amount invested in T3 is z and the return is maximized.
Note that the mean risk factor corresponding to (x,y,z) is (x+3*y+2z)/(x+y+z)
